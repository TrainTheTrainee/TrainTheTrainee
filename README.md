- 👋 Hello, My name is Corben, i'm new to coding
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge in coding vastly and using the collective knowledge to give back to the community in a more simplified/detailed way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as a language and creating random programs to exercise my understanding.
- 💞️ Open to collaboration/projects to see new heights.
- 📫 I'm reachable through email @TrainingCorben@gmail.com or Message me.
